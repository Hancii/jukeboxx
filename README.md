# jukeboxx
This project represents a model of jukebox. 
It gives an option of chosing wanted artists or categories and it lists out songs that are compatible by the category or the artist.
After the song has been chosen, the application gives you a YouTube-link linked to that specific song.
This Desktop app represents only the idea of jukebox, but it is very practical becuase the biggest memory consuming atribute is the YouTube link and not the whole song.
Hana's jukebox is a desktop-app made using JAVA in IntelliJ as a Maven project. It includes singleton pattern and CRUD model.
